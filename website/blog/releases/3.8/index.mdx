We are happy to announce **Docusaurus 3.8**.

This release significantly improves build performance, introduces useful new features, and includes future flags to prepare your site for the next Docusaurus version.

Upgrading should be easy. Our [release process](/community/release-process) respects [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Minor versions do not include any breaking changes.

## Highlight

## Performance

As announced, this release significantly improves our infrastructure performance with various optimizations, and 2 new Docusaurus Faster options.

### Docusaurus Faster

[Docusaurus Faster](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/10556) has been introduced in [Docusaurus v3.6](/blog/releases/3.6#docusaurus-faster), and permits you to opt-in for an upgraded build infrastructure. The experimental flags can be turned on individually, but we recommend to turn all the flags on at once with this convenient shortcut:

```js
const config = {
  future: {
    experimental_faster: true,
  },
};
```

:::tip

Don't forget to install the `@docusaurus/faster` dependency first!

#### Persistent Cache

In [#10931](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/10931), we have enabled the **[Rspack persitent cache](https://rspack.dev/blog/announcing-1-2#persistent-cache)**. Similarly to the [Webpack persistent cache](https://webpack.js.org/blog/2020-10-10-webpack-5-release/#persistent-caching) (that we already supported), it permits to build your site faster on subsequent builds, greatly reducing the time it takes to bundle the app. This feature depends on using the [Rspack bundler](https://rspack.dev/), and can be turned on with the `rspackPersistentCache` flag:

```js
const config = {
  future: {
    experimental_faster: {
      rspackBundler: true, // required flag
      rspackPersistentCache: true, // new flag
    },
  },
};
```

:::caution Preserve the cache

The persistent cache requires preserving the `./node_modules/.cache` folder across builds.

Popular CDNs such as Netlify and Vercel do that for you automatically. Depending on your CI and deployment pipeline, additional configuration may be needed to preserve the cache.

It should work by default locally. In case you encounter any problem, running the `docusaurus clear` command will clear the `./node_modules/.cache` folder.

#### Worker Threads

In [#10826](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/10826), we introduced a [Node.js Worker Thread pool](https://github.com/tinylibs/tinypool) to run the static side generation code. Unlike our traditional strategy, this permits to better leverage all the available CPUs, reduce static site generation times, and contain potential memory leaks. This feature can be turned on with the `ssgWorkerThreads` flag:

```js
const config = {
  future: {
    experimental_faster: {
      ssgWorkerThreads: true,
    },
  },
};
```

### Optimizations

We have also optimized various bottlenecks:

In [#11007](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/11007), we optimized the dev server startup time for macOS users. We figured out that the code to open your browser used expensive synchronous/blocking calls that prevented the bundler from doing its work. From now on, the bundler and the macOS browser opening will run in parallel, leading to a faster `docusaurus start` experience for all macOS users.

In [#11163](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/11163), we noticed that the docs `showLastUpdateAuthor` and `showLastUpdateTime` are quite expensive, and require to run a `git log` command for each document. On large sites, running these commands in parallel can exhaust the system and lead to Node.js `EBADF` errors. We implemented a Git command queue to avoid exhausting the system, which also slightly increased performance of our plugin's `loadContent()` lifecycle.

In [#10885](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/10885), we implemented an SVG sprite for the external link icon. Due to its repeated appearance in various places of your site (navbar, footer, sidebars...), using a React SVG component lead to duplicated SVG markup in the final HTML. Using a sprite permits to only embed the icon SVG once, reducing the generated HTML size and the static generation time. We [plan to use more SVG sprites](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/5865) in the future.

In [#11176](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/11176), we fine-tuned the webpack/Rspack configuration to remove useless optimizations. If you have a very large site and bundling time is a concern, you might consider disabling other optimizations like `optimization.concatenateModule`. Refer to the linked issue for instructions and information on the tradeoffs involved.
